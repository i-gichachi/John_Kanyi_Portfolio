        executiveSummary:
            "When a major bilateral donor announced a highly competitive $43 million funding opportunity spanning three African countries, I was tasked with leading the entire proposal development process with just six weeks on the clock. Coordinating across multiple country offices, technical teams and more than 15 individual budgets in a fully remote environment, I developed a structured proposal management system that delivered a compliant and strategically competitive submission on time. The result was one of HJFMRI's largest regional wins, a full award of $43 million that significantly expanded the organisation's sub-Saharan Africa portfolio, deepened key donor and implementing partnerships and laid the foundation for a proposal management framework that continues to improve our bid win rates to this day. What made this win particularly meaningful was not just the number, but what it proved: that a well-coordinated remote team, armed with the right tools and clear accountability, can compete and win at the highest levels of international development funding.",
        context:
            "In mid-2021, HJFMRI responded to a significant bilateral donor opportunity requiring a fully integrated multi-country programme design across three African nations. As Senior Regional Business Development and Grants Manager, I was the lead coordinator responsible for the end-to-end proposal development process, bringing together dispersed country offices, technical writers, finance leads and partnership teams under a single unified submission. The scale and geographic complexity of this opportunity placed it among the most ambitious bids the regional office had ever undertaken, and the expectation was clear: we had to win it.",
        challenge:
            "The core challenge was one of coordination under extreme time pressure. With only six weeks available, the team faced the simultaneous demands of aligning technical narratives across three distinct country-level frameworks, consolidating more than 15 individual budgets into a coherent and donor-compliant financial structure and ensuring that all partnership and cost-sharing approaches were consistent across every implementing site. Working entirely remotely added another layer of complexity, as there was no shared office environment to fall back on for quick conversations or last-minute alignment. Any misalignment in technical positioning, budget compliance or partner framing risked disqualifying us from one of the most significant funding opportunities the organisation had pursued in the region.",

                description:
                    "My first priority was to replace uncertainty with structure. I developed a comprehensive proposal management plan that mapped every deliverable, responsible owner and deadline across the full six-week timeline. A detailed Gantt chart became the operational backbone of the entire process, giving every contributor across multiple time zones a shared and transparent view of responsibilities, task dependencies and submission milestones. This upfront investment in planning infrastructure was what transformed what could easily have been a fragmented and reactive process into a coordinated, trackable and confidence-inspiring workflow.",

                    "With the framework in place, I led the coordination of technical writers, finance teams and country office leads through structured remote collaboration sessions. I developed standardised templates to ensure that each country's technical approach and budget assumptions were framed consistently, significantly reducing the risk of contradictions or gaps within the consolidated submission. Regular structured checkpoints kept all workstreams on schedule and created a rhythm of accountability that allowed the team to surface and resolve misalignments well before they could become compliance risks.",

                description:
                    "In the final stretch, I conducted a thorough compliance review of the full consolidated proposal, cross-referencing donor regulations against every section of the technical narrative and financial documentation. This was not a box-ticking exercise; it was a deliberate effort to ensure that the submission was not only fully compliant but also strategically compelling and clearly differentiated in a competitive field. The result was a proposal the entire team was proud to submit.",

        quantifiableOutcomes: [
            "Full award of $43 million secured across three African countries.",
            "More than 15 individual budgets successfully consolidated into a single compliant financial submission.",
            "Entire proposal delivered within a six-week timeline with zero compliance issues at submission.",
            "Programme has since expanded into West Africa, growing HJFMRI's regional footprint beyond the original three-country scope.",
        ],
        qualitativeAchievements: [
            "Marked one of HJFMRI's largest regional wins, significantly strengthening the organisation's credibility and standing with the bilateral donor.",
            "Deepened strategic partnerships with both the donor and multiple implementing organisations across all three programme countries.",
            "The proposal management plan and templates developed for this bid became a reusable internal framework that has since improved win rates and coordination quality on subsequent competitive opportunities.",
            "Demonstrated conclusively that complex, multi-country proposals can be led and delivered to the highest standard in a fully remote environment.",
            "Elevated the regional office's reputation internally as a high-performing, well-coordinated business development unit capable of handling the organisation's most ambitious bids.",
        ],
        keyTakeaway:
            "The most powerful lesson I took from this engagement was that in high-stakes, time-pressured environments, structure is itself a competitive advantage. By investing early in the right planning tools, clear accountability frameworks and disciplined coordination rhythms, I was able to convert genuine complexity into clarity and give every team member the confidence and focus to deliver their very best work under real pressure. That insight has shaped how I approach every major bid I have led since.",
        conclusion:
            "This case study reflects my ability to lead large-scale, multi-stakeholder proposal processes from initial strategy through to successful award, even under significant time constraints and across a fully remote, multi-country environment. The $43 million win was not simply a funding milestone for the organisation; it was concrete proof that disciplined remote coordination, rigorous compliance management and strategic positioning can consistently deliver results that matter at the very highest levels of international development.",

Most of our partners had never managed grants of this scale, creating real risks of compliance failures and implementation delays. Through robust sub-grants systems, 40+ organisational capacity assessments and innovative co-financing strategies, the project generated $34.8 million in new agricultural sales and left behind a replicable grants management model that outlasted the programme itself.",

            "From 2010 to 2014, I served as Grants Manager on the $32 million USAID Kenya Horticulture Competitiveness Project (KHCP), implemented by Fintrac Inc. to improve agricultural productivity, market access and export competitiveness for smallholder farmers across Kenya. My role covered the full sub-grant lifecycle across a network of 50+ local implementing partners, from partner selection and risk assessment through to disbursement, monitoring and closeout.",
        challenge:
            "Most of our local partners had never managed grants of this size, meaning the programme faced genuine risks of non-compliance, financial mismanagement and delayed implementation without deliberate intervention. Added to this was a co-financing requirement of $19 million that needed to be mobilised from non-traditional sources including agricultural input suppliers, cooperatives and private sector actors. Delivering on both fronts simultaneously, across 50+ geographically dispersed partners, demanded rigorous systems and genuine relationship-building in equal measure.",

        keyTakeaway:
            "The most enduring lesson from KHCP was that compliance and capacity are two sides of the same coin. When you genuinely invest in building a partner's ability to manage grants well, compliance stops being something you enforce from above and becomes a standard that partners own and uphold themselves, and that shift is what turns a good project into a lasting legacy.",

I led a deliberate partnership development initiative, engaging national ministries of health, leading research universities and hospital networks across target countries and negotiating formal frameworks aligned with both organisational priorities and funder requirements. The results were transformative: HJFMRI expanded into three new countries, unlocked previously inaccessible European and private donor funding streams and grew the regional pipeline to 30+ active opportunities worth more than $250M, sustaining a 65% win rate on major bids over two years.",

        challenge:
            "In several target countries, HJFMRI lacked formal partnerships with national ministries of health, research universities and hospital networks that European donors and private philanthropies require before committing to major awards.

I responded by building a comprehensive compliance and capacity framework from the ground up, conducting pre-award risk assessments, delivering tailored training and developing standardised monitoring tools that strengthened financial accountability across every level of the programme. The results were definitive: zero material compliance issues throughout the entire project lifecycle, a 40% improvement in partner submission timeliness, a 50% reduction in corrective action requests and $21.1M in verified trade deals facilitated through strengthened market linkages across Kenya's livestock sector.",
        context:
            "From March 2014 to October 2016, I served as Grants Manager on the $20M USDA-funded K-SALES Project implemented by Land O'Lakes International Development across Kenya's dairy and meat value chains. Operating through a network of 30+ local implementing partners including farmer cooperatives, agribusiness firms and market linkage organisations, my role covered the full grant management lifecycle from pre-award risk assessment and partner selection through to disbursement oversight, compliance monitoring and performance tracking.",
        challenge:
            "The majority of our local partners carried significant financial management weaknesses, including inadequate internal controls, inconsistent reporting practices and limited familiarity with USDA procurement and compliance requirements. Left unaddressed, these gaps created a very real risk of material compliance failures, audit findings and implementation delays that could have jeopardised not just individual sub-awards but the credibility and continuity of the entire $20M programme. The task was clear: build the systems and human capacity needed to protect the programme's financial integrity while keeping 30+ geographically dispersed partners aligned and delivering on their programmatic commitments.",

                    "I began with thorough pre-award risk assessments across all 30+ local partners, evaluating each organisation's financial management systems, internal controls and governance structures against USDA compliance requirements. The findings informed a risk-tiered approach to partner management and drove the development of standardised compliance tools and monitoring frameworks that gave the entire programme a consistent and auditable compliance architecture from day one.",

This proactive approach was central to maintaining the programme's clean compliance record and full financial accountability across the $20M portfolio from first disbursement to final closeout.",

        conclusion:
            "This case study demonstrates my ability to diagnose, design and deliver comprehensive compliance and capacity solutions across complex multi-partner grant portfolios, turning financial management weaknesses into programme strengths without compromising results or disrupting implementation. The zero audit findings, $21.1M in verified trade deals and lasting institutional improvements across 30+ partner organisations reflect what disciplined, hands-on grants management can achieve when rigorous oversight is combined with genuine investment in local capacity.",
