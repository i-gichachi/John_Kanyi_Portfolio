        title: "Business Development and Strategic Positioning",
        pillar: "Funding and Business Development",
        description:
            "Building and winning competitive funding opportunities is at the heart of what I do. At HJFMRI, I led business development across 15+ African countries, constructing a regional pipeline of 30+ active opportunities worth more than $250M by aligning technical teams with funder priorities during the early capture phase. That disciplined, intelligence-led approach delivered a 65% win rate on major bids over two years and secured $100M+ annually from USG agencies, the EU, WHO and private donors, consistently translating strategic positioning into real funding outcomes.",

        title: "Grants and Contract Management",
        pillar: "Grants and Programme Management",
        description:
            "I have managed the full grant and contract lifecycle across some of the most complex donor environments in sub-Saharan Africa. At HJFMRI, I oversaw post-award monitoring for $75M+ in grants, contracts and cooperative agreements from USAID, CDC and global health donors, achieving zero major audit findings throughout. By streamlining pre- and post-award workflows through standardised checklists and cross-functional reviews, I reduced proposal turnaround time by 30% while simultaneously lowering compliance risks across a portfolio spanning HIV/TB programmes, health systems strengthening and vaccine delivery.",

        title: "Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening",
        pillar: "Capacity and Leadership",
        description:
            "I believe that lasting development impact depends on the strength of local systems, not just external funding. Across my career I have built the operational and financial capacity of 200+ local organisations and 100+ grant recipients, designing tailored training programmes on grant management, procurement and financial reporting. At Land O'Lakes, my capacity-building interventions improved partner submission timeliness by 40% and reduced corrective action requests by half, while at St. John's Community Centre my work enabled several grassroots organisations to successfully transition to direct USAID funding within two years.",

        id: 4,
        title: "Compliance Oversight and Risk Management",
        pillar: "Grants and Programme Management",
        description:
            "Maintaining airtight compliance across large, multi-country portfolios is a professional standard I have never compromised on. At Fintrac Inc., I administered a $32M USAID project while maintaining a 100% compliance rate with complex USG procurement and financial regulations and reducing partner audit findings by over 60% through rigorous capacity assessments and field monitoring. Throughout my career spanning CHF International, Land O'Lakes and HJFMRI, I have sustained zero material compliance issues across every portfolio I have managed, a record I attribute to building compliance into programme design rather than treating it as an afterthought.",

        id: 5,
        title: "Financial Management and Budget Oversight",
        pillar: "Grants and Programme Management",
        description:
            "Sound financial stewardship is a thread that runs through every role I have held. At Fintrac Inc., I supervised 50+ local sub-grantees, reconciling technical milestone achievements against budgetary disbursements to ensure 98% of funds were utilised on schedule across a $32M programme. My financial oversight has consistently protected donor investments, from managing sub-grant expenditures across 14 HIV-service partners at CHF International to conducting regular field audits at Land O'Lakes that maintained full compliance with USG procurement standards and generated $21.1M in verified trade deals through strategically managed market linkages.",

        id: 6,
        title: "Stakeholder Engagement and Partnership Development",
        pillar: "Funding and Business Development",
        description:
            "I have built and sustained high-value relationships with some of the most influential stakeholders in international development, from national ministries of health and leading research universities to hospital networks and bilateral donors. At HJFMRI, I forged new institutional partnerships that expanded our local footprint into three new countries and unlocked previously inaccessible funding streams. These relationships are not transactional; they are strategic assets that have consistently delivered 95%+ donor satisfaction scores across 20+ active awards and opened doors to European and private partnerships that fundamentally shifted the regional funding landscape.",
    },

        id: 7,
        title: "Proposal Development and Donor Reporting",
        pillar: "Funding and Business Development",
        description:
            "Writing winning proposals and producing high-quality donor reports are skills I have refined across 17 years and dozens of funding cycles. At HJFMRI, I coordinated technical, finance and compliance teams to submit 40+ competitive bids that grew annual grant revenue by 20% over five years, while my standardised reporting frameworks cut average closeout timelines by 25%. My published research on stakeholder engagement and emotional intelligence reflects the same rigour I bring to every proposal narrative, grounding donor communications in evidence, strategy and a clear understanding of funder priorities.",
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        title: "Monitoring, Evaluation and Programme Performance",
        pillar: "Capacity and Leadership",
        description:
            "I approach monitoring and evaluation as a strategic management tool, not a compliance exercise. At CHF International, I designed practical monitoring tools that tracked sub-grant expenditures, disbursements and performance indicators across 14 local HIV-service partners, directly improving the quality of financial and narrative reporting within a single quarter. At Fintrac Inc., linking financial data to programme outcomes enabled more responsive decision-making by senior leadership and ensured that 98% of a $32M portfolio was delivered on schedule against technical milestones, demonstrating my ability to connect ground-level data to strategic programme direction.",
    },
    {
        id: 9,
        title: "Remote and Cross-Cultural Programme Leadership",
        pillar: "Capacity and Leadership",
        description:
            "Leading complex programmes across multiple time zones, cultures and institutional environments is something I have done throughout my career, long before remote work became mainstream. At HJFMRI, I managed a regional portfolio spanning 15+ African countries entirely in a remote capacity, coordinating across six country offices and engaging stakeholders from Nairobi to Washington with equal fluency. As a native Swahili speaker and fluent English communicator, I bring genuine cross-cultural intelligence to every team I work with, enabling the trust and clarity that distributed, high-stakes programme environments demand.",
