        "Hello, I am John Kanyi, a Senior Grants and Business Development Leader with over 17 years of experience securing and managing large-scale donor-funded programmes across sub-Saharan Africa. My core mission is simple: to help organisations win the right funding, deliver it with integrity, and build the institutional capacity to sustain impact long after the grant closes.",
        "My track record speaks for itself. At HJFMRI, I built and managed a regional pipeline of 30+ active opportunities worth over $250M, achieving a 65% win rate on major bids and securing $100M+ annually from USG agencies, the EU, WHO and private donors. Earlier in my career, I directed a $32M USAID programme that generated $34.8M in new agricultural sales and transformed the livelihoods of 200,000 smallholder farmers, all while maintaining a 100% compliance rate with complex USG procurement regulations.",
        "I am highly proficient in GMS software, ERP systems, SharePoint and the full Google and Microsoft ecosystems, tools that allow me to manage complex, multi-country portfolios entirely remotely. As a fluent English and native Swahili speaker, I communicate seamlessly across diverse cultural and institutional contexts, a skill that has proven invaluable when coordinating across six country offices and engaging stakeholders from Nairobi to Washington.",
        "My professional standing is anchored by five internationally recognised credentials, GPC, PMP, CFCM, CPA and PMD, alongside two peer-reviewed publications and active membership in the Grants Professional Association, NCMA and NGMA. I bring not just experience, but a demonstrated, evidence-based commitment to excellence in every programme I touch.",
